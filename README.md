# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction
---
# üìú Overview
Accurately predicting loan approvals is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risk and optimize lending decisions. This project applies machine learning to develop a predictive model that determines whether a loan application should be approved based on various applicant details.

The dataset includes key features such as income, loan amount, credit history, employment status, and other financial indicators. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models, this project aims to build an efficient system for automated loan approval prediction.

üöÄ Project Workflow
Data Collection & Preprocessing

1- **Data was sourced from**
  - test dataset: https://github.com/Basmala9100/Loan-Approval/blob/main/test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv 
  - train dataset: https://github.com/Basmala9100/Loan-Approval/blob/main/train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv . 
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

2- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Analyzing trends in approved vs. rejected applications.
  - Identifying key features affecting loan approval outcomes.

3- **Feature Engineering**
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, marital status).
  - caling numerical features for better model accuracy.

4- **Model Selection & Training**
  - Implementing models such as:
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Trees
    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosting
  - Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
